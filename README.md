  using the K-Mean algorithm we make the cluster of customer on the basis of spending score in month,year and number of shoping 
  frequency.
  if spending score is closer to 1 means customer he/she spend less and if spending score is closer to 100 means customer
  spend more .
  
  Elbow method is used tp find the number  of cluster .
